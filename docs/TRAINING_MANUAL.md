## Lesson 7: Heat Cycle Tracking

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Record heat cycle dates
- Track cycle patterns
- Predict upcoming heats
- Plan breeding schedules
- Set heat cycle reminders

### Why Track Heat Cycles?

Heat cycle tracking is essential for:

- **Breeding Planning**: Know when females are fertile
- **Health Monitoring**: Identify irregularities
- **Schedule Coordination**: Plan for optimal breeding times
- **Stud Booking**: Reserve stud services in advance
- **Litter Spacing**: Maintain healthy intervals between litters

> 💡 **Tip**: Most dogs cycle every 6-7 months, but this varies by breed and individual dog.

### Understanding Heat Cycles

#### The Four Stages

**1. Proestrus (7-10 days)**

- Vulva swelling begins
- Bloody discharge
- Attracts males but won't breed
- Not fertile yet

**2. Estrus (5-9 days)**

- Standing heat - receptive to males
- Discharge lightens (straw-colored)
- Ovulation occurs
- **FERTILE PERIOD** 🔴

**3. Diestrus (60-90 days)**

- Heat signs end
- May have false pregnancy
- Not fertile

**4. Anestrus (4-5 months)**

- Normal period between heats
- Reproductive rest

### Recording a Heat Cycle

![Screenshot: Dog profile with Heat Cycles tab highlighted]

#### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Access Heat Cycle Tracking**

1. Navigate to **Dogs** page
2. Click on a female dog's profile
3. Select **"Heat Cycles"** tab
4. Click **"+ Add Heat Cycle"** button

**2. Enter Start Date**

- **First Day of Heat**: Date when you first notice signs
- Use calendar picker
- Format: MM/DD/YYYY
- Most accurate if recorded on day 1

> 💡 **Tip**: Set a reminder to check your females regularly so you catch day 1

**3. Record Key Information**

**Start Date** (Required)

- First day of bleeding/swelling
- Example: 03/15/2025

**End Date** (Optional)

- Last day of discharge
- Usually 14-21 days after start
- Can add later if unsure

**Breeding Window**

- Days 10-14 typically
- Can vary by individual
- Mark best breeding days

**Notes Field**

- Behavioral changes observed
- Intensity of heat
- Any complications
- Stud used (if bred)
- Example: "Strong heat, bred on day 12 with Max"

**4. Save the Record**

- Click **"Save"**
- Heat cycle appears in timeline
- Next heat prediction calculated

### Viewing Heat Cycle History

#### Heat Cycle Timeline

![Screenshot: Heat cycle timeline showing multiple cycles]

**What You See:**

- Chronological list of all heats
- Start and end dates
- Days between cycles
- Notes for each cycle
- Breeding records linked

**Color Coding:**

- 🔵 Blue = Past heats
- 🟡 Yellow = Current heat
- 🟢 Green = Predicted upcoming heat

#### Heat Cycle Statistics

**Average Cycle Length**

- Calculated from your data
- Updates with each new cycle
- Individual to each dog
- More accurate over time

**Example:**

```
Average Cycle: 6.5 months
Last Heat: 03/15/2025
Next Predicted: 09/30/2025
Confidence: High (based on 5 previous cycles)
```

### Predicting Upcoming Heats

#### How Predictions Work

**Algorithm Factors:**

1. Average cycle length from past heats
2. Recent cycle pattern trends
3. Dog's age and maturity
4. Seasonal variations (if applicable)

**Prediction Accuracy:**

- **High**: 4+ recorded cycles, regular pattern
- **Medium**: 2-3 recorded cycles
- **Low**: 0-1 recorded cycles

> ⚠️ **Note**: Predictions are estimates. Always watch for actual heat signs.

#### Dashboard Heat Predictions

![Screenshot: Dashboard showing upcoming heats widget]

**From Dashboard:**

- See all females' predicted heats
- Days until next heat
- Sorted by date
- Color-coded urgency:
  - 🔴 Red: Within 7 days
  - 🟡 Orange: Within 30 days
  - 🟢 Green: 30+ days away

### Setting Heat Cycle Reminders

#### Automatic Reminders

**System Sends Alerts:**

- 30 days before predicted heat
- 7 days before predicted heat
- When heat is predicted to start

**Notification Channels:**

- Email notifications
- In-app notifications
- Calendar integration (optional)

#### Manual Reminders

**Create Custom Reminders:**

1. Open dog profile
2. Go to Calendar/Reminders
3. Click "Add Reminder"
4. Select "Heat Cycle Check"
5. Set date
6. Add notes
7. Save

**Good Reminder Times:**

- Monthly checks for signs
- Pre-breeding health checks
- Stud service booking dates

### Breeding Planning with Heat Cycles

#### Optimal Breeding Times

**General Guidelines:**

- Day 10-14 of heat cycle
- When discharge lightens
- Female stands for male
- Progesterone testing confirms

**Planning Steps:**

1. Review heat cycle history
2. Note predicted heat date
3. Book stud service in advance
4. Schedule progesterone tests
5. Set reminders for breeding window

#### Tracking Breeding Attempts

**Record Breeding:**

1. During heat cycle, note breeding date
2. Add to heat cycle notes
3. Link to breeding record
4. Calculate expected due date (63 days)
5. Create litter record

![Screenshot: Heat cycle with breeding information linked]

### Managing Irregular Cycles

#### Identifying Issues

**Red Flags:**

- Cycles less than 4 months apart
- Cycles more than 12 months apart
- Split heats (heat stops and restarts)
- Very short heats (less than 5 days)
- No heats by age 24 months

**What to Do:**

1. Document all observations
2. Record in notes
3. Consult veterinarian
4. Consider hormone testing
5. Update dog's health records

#### Silent Heats

**What Are Silent Heats?**

- Ovulation occurs
- No visible signs
- Can still conceive
- More common in some breeds

**How to Track:**

- Regular progesterone testing
- Veterinary monitoring
- Blood tests every 2-3 months
- Note in dog's profile

### Heat Cycle and Health

#### Normal vs. Concerning

**Normal Heat Cycle:**

- Clear to bloody discharge
- Mild to moderate swelling
- Normal appetite and energy
- Attracts male dogs
- Lasts 2-3 weeks total

**Concerning Signs:**

- Foul-smelling discharge
- Excessive bleeding
- Lethargy or fever
- Loss of appetite
- Prolonged heat (4+ weeks)

**Action Required:**

- Contact veterinarian
- Record symptoms in health tracking
- Don't breed if abnormal
- Follow vet recommendations

### Age-Related Considerations

#### First Heat

**Typical Age:**

- Small breeds: 6-12 months
- Medium breeds: 8-14 months
- Large breeds: 10-18 months
- Giant breeds: 18-24 months

**Best Practices:**

- Record first heat date
- Note dog's age at first heat
- Don't breed on first heat
- Wait until physical maturity

#### Senior Dogs

**Aging Considerations:**

- Dogs don't go through menopause
- Cycles may become irregular
- Longer intervals between heats
- Retirement recommendations:
  - Small breeds: 7-8 years
  - Large breeds: 5-6 years
